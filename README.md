I'm learning PowerShell. I will post my work here.
These scripts are not signed and thus you should probably not trust me enough to run them. However if you want to live on the dangerous side of life you will probably need to use cmdlet <Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser> before the script will run.
